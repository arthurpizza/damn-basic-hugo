I just wanted a simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site. I mean really simple. Just some blog posts and pages. Something that can be dropped in place of a Wordpress or Jekyll site.

Almost ZERO css and HTML. Make it your own.

**This is a work in progress.**

Make sure every post is like this.

```yaml

title: About
slug: /about/
layout: page

```
